 * Pinned versions of the build-time toolchains the packagers install.
 *
 * The Flatpak sandbox vendors these versions as offline sources (prebuilt
 * binaries), while the deb/rpm source packages install the very same versions
 * at build time (compiling cargo-zigbuild against the build host's glibc).
 *
 * `wasm-bindgen` (Cargo.toml), Node (package.json `engines`) and pnpm
 * (`packageManager`) are deliberately absent: they are derived from the project
 * so they always track what it actually builds with.
